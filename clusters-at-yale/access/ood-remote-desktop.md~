# Remote Desktop

Occasionally, it is helpful to use a graphical interface to explore data or run certain programs. Remote Desktops are available through our cluster [Web Portals](/clusters-at-yale/access/ood).
Information on accessing the web portal is available on [Access the Web Portal](/clusters-at-yale/access/ood) documentation page. 
From the Web Portal, you are able to launch interactive apps such as Remote Desktops.
In the past options were to use VNC or [X11 forwarding](/clusters-at-yale/access/x11).
These tools can be complex to setup or suffer from reduced performance.
The Remote Desktop app simplifies the configuration of a VNC desktop session on a compute node.

To get started, connect to one of cluster [Web Portals](/clusters-at-yale/access/ood) and choose Remote Desktop from the Interactive Apps menu or the dashboard and then follow the instructions for [launching an interactive app](/clusters-at-yale/access/ood/#launch-an-interactive-app).

## Copy/Paste

In some browsers, you may have to use a special text box to copy and paste from the Remote Desktop App. Click the arrow on the left side of your window for a menu, then click the clipboard icon to get access to your Remote Desktop's clipboard.
