Yale [recently joined the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC)](https://research.computing.yale.edu/about/yale-joins-mghpcc), a not-for-profit, state-of-the-art data center dedicated to computationally-intensive research. We are pleased to announce our first installation at MGHPCC will be a new HPC cluster called Bouchet. Bouchet is named for Edward Bouchet (1852-1918), the first self-identified African American to earn a doctorate from an American university, a PhD in physics at Yale University in 1876.

## Announcing the Bouchet HPC Cluster

The Bouchet HPC cluster will be available in beta Fall 2024. The first installation of nodes, approximately 4,000 direct-liquid-cooled cores, will be dedicated to tightly coupled parallel workflows, such as those run in the “mpi” partition on the Grace cluster. Later on this year we will be acquiring and installing a large number of general purpose compute nodes as well as GPU-enabled compute nodes. At that point Bouchet will be available to all Yale researchers for computational work involving low-risk data.

Ultimately, Bouchet is the planned successor to both Grace and McCleary, with the majority of HPC infrastructure refreshes and growth deployed at MGHPCC going forward. However, we are still in the early stages of planning that transition and will continue to operate both Grace and McCleary in their current form for a number of years. More details will be provided as we consult with faculty and researchers about the transition and how we can minimize disruptions to critical work. To this effect, we will be convening a faculty advisory committee this fall to ensure a smooth migration.
