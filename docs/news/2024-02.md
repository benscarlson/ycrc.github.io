## February 2024

### Announcements

#### Milgram Maintenance

The biannual scheduled maintenance for the Milgram cluster will be occurring Feb 6-8. During this time, the cluster will be unavailable. See the Milgram maintenance email announcements for more details. 


#### Changes to RStudio on the Web Portal

The “RStudio Server” app on the Open OnDemand web portal has been upgraded to support both the R software modules and R installed via conda. As such the “RStudio Desktop” app has been retired and removed from the web portal. If you still require RStudio Desktop, we provide [instructions for running under the “Remote Desktop” app](https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/access/ood/#start-rstudio-desktop-in-remote-desktop) (please note that this is not a recommended practice for most users).


### Software Highlights

- ChimeraX is now available as an app on the McCleary Open OnDemand web portal
- **FSL/6.0.5.2-centos7_64** is now available on McCleary
