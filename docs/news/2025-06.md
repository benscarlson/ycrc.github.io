### Announcements

#### Faster startups for modules and cluster apps including RStudio, R and RELION

We've introduced a new "fast module loading" feature that significantly reduces wait times when loading software modules on our McCleary and Grace clusters.

What You'll Notice
- The [RStudio OpenOnDemand app](https://ood-mccleary.ycrc.yale.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/ycrc_rstudio_server/session_contexts/new) now launches in about 10 seconds (down from 40 seconds previously), thanks to this optimization running automatically in the background.
- From the command line, load times of large and complex [modules](/applications/modules) like R and RELION can be reduced to a few seconds by loading the new [‘mlq’](/modules/#fast-module-loading) module and using ‘ml’ to load these modules, i.e.: 'module load mlq; ml R’ instead of ‘module load R’
- If you encounter any problems with fast module loading in our RStudio app, it can be disabled with a new checkbox that appears at the top of the web form.  We developed this tool in house and continue testing and refining it.

### Software Highlights

- **PyTorch/2.1.2-foss-2022b-CUDA-12.1.1** (with CUDA support) is now available on Bouchet
