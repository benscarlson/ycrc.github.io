### Announcements

#### Open OnDeamnd VSCode

A new OOD app code-server is now available on all clusters, except Milgram (coming in Feb). Code-server allows you to run VSCode in a browser on a compute node. All users who have been running VSCode on a login node via the ssh extension should switch to code-server immediately.  The app allows you to use GPUs, to allocate large memories, and to specify a private partition (if you have the access), things you wonâ€™t be able to do if you run VSCode on a login node. The app is still in beta version and your feedback is much appreciated.

#### Milgram Transfer Node

Milgram now has a node dedicated to data transfers to and from the cluster. To access the node from within Milgram, run `ssh transfer` from the login node. To upload or download data from Milgram via the transfer node, use the hostname `transfer-milgram.hpc.yale.edu` (must be on VPN). More information can be found in our [Transfer Data documentation](/data/transfer/).

With the addition of the new transfer node, we ask that the login nodes are no longer used for data transfers to limit impact on regular login activities.
