### Announcements

A new OOD app code-server is now available on all clusters, except Milgram (coming in Feb). Code-server allows you to run VSCode in a browser on a compute node. All users who have been running VSCode on a login node via the ssh extension should switch to code-server immediately.  The app allows you to use GPUs, to allocate large memories, and to specify a private partition (if you have the access), things you wonâ€™t be able to do if you run VSCode on a login node. The app is still in beta version and your feedback is much appreciated.
