## Farnam Maintenance
_April 4-7, 2022_

### Software Updates

- Security updates
- Slurm updated to 21.08.6
- NVIDIA drivers updated to 510.47.03 (note: driver for NVIDIA K80 GPUs was upgraded to 470.103.01)
- Singularity replaced by Apptainer version 1.0.1 (note: the "singularity" command will still work as expected)
- Open OnDemand updated to 2.0.20

### Hardware Updates

- Four new nodes with 4 NVIDIA GTX3090 GPUs each have been added

### Changes to the `bigmem` Partition

Jobs requesting less than 120G of memory are no longer allowed in the "bigmem" partition. Please submit these jobs to the general or scavenge partitions instead.

### Changes to non-interactive sessions

Non-interactive sessions (e.g. file transfers, commands sent over ssh) no longer load the standard cluster environment to alleviate performance issues due to unnecessary module loads.
Please contact us if this change affects your workflow so we can resolve the issue or provide a workaround.
