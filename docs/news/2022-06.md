### Announcements

#### Farnam Decommission & McCleary Announcement

After more than six years in service, we will be retiring the Farnam HPC cluster later this year. Farnam will be replaced with a new HPC cluster, McCleary. The McCleary HPC cluster will be Yale's first direct-to-chip liquid cooled cluster, moving the YCRC and the Yale research computing community into a more environmentally friendly future. For more information about the decommission process and the launch of McCleary, see [our website](/clusters/farnam-decommission).

#### RStudio (with module R) has been retired from Open OnDemand as of June 1st

Please switch to RStudio Server which provides a better user experience. For users using a conda environment with RStudio, RStudio (with Conda R) will continue to be served on Open OnDemand.

#### Milgram Maintenance
The biannual scheduled maintenance for the Milgram cluster will be occurring June 7-9. During this time, the cluster will be unavailable. See the Milgram maintenance email announcements for more details.

### Software Highlights

- **QTLtools/1.3.1-foss-2020b** is now available on Farnam.
