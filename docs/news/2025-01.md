### Announcements

#### Bouchet Beta

The YCRCâ€™s first installation at MGHPCC, Bouchet, is currently available for beta testing. For the beta period, we are explicitly and exclusively seeking tightly coupled, parallel workloads. In early 2025, we will be acquiring and installing a large number of general purpose compute nodes as well as GPU-enabled compute nodes. At that point Bouchet will be available to all Yale researchers for computational work involving low-risk data. If you have a suitable workload we encourage you to [request access](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjJYSkpyu-UqGH09Tgp2HS3xQ0NFjLOdg6_pRAMDKr4uiU0w/viewform) to participate in beta testing.
