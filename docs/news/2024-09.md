#### The YCRC is Hiring!

The YCRC is looking to add permanent members to our Research Support team. If helping others use the clusters and learning about other work done at the YCRC interests you, consider joining the YCRC! If you have any questions about the position, contact Kaylea Nelson ([kaylea.nelson@yale.edu](mailto:kaylea.nelson@yale.edu)).

#### Clarity Access

Yale is launching the [Clarity platform](https://ai.yale.edu/yales-ai-tools-and-resources/clarity-platform). In its initial phase, Clarity offers an AI chatbot powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o. Importantly, Clarity provides a “walled-off” environment; its use is limited to Yale faculty, students, and staff, and information entered into its chatbot is not saved or used to train external AI models. Clarity is appropriate for use with all data types, including [high-risk data](https://your.yale.edu/policies-procedures/policies/1604-data-classification-policy, provided that [all security standards](https://cybersecurity.yale.edu/mss) are observed. Its chatbot is capable of content creation, coding assistance, data and image analysis, text-to-speech, and more. Over time, the platform may expand to incorporate additional AI tools, including other [large language models](https://ai.yale.edu/guidance/learn-about-ai#keyterms). Clarity is designed to evolve as generative AI develops and the community offers feedback. 

*Before using the Clarity AI chatbot, please review [training resources](https://ai.yale.edu/yales-ai-tools-and-resources/clarity-platform#training) and [guidance](https://ai.yale.edu/yales-ai-tools-and-resources/clarity-platform/clarity-platform-faqs) on appropriate use.*

#### Job Performance Monitoring
We have recently deployed a new tool for measuring and monitoring job performance called `jobstats`. Available on all clusters, `jobstats` provides a report of the utilization of CPU, Memory, and GPU resources for in-progress and recently completed jobs. To generate the report simply run (replacing the ID number of the job in question):

```
[ab123@grace ~]$ jobstats 123456789

======================================================================
                         Slurm Job Statistics

                         Overall Utilization
======================================================================
  CPU utilization  [|||||||||||||                            26%]
  CPU memory usage [||||                                      8%]

                         Detailed Utilization
======================================================================
  CPU utilization per node (CPU time used/run time)
      r816u29n04: 1-07:48:36/5-02:54:45 (efficiency=25.9%)

  CPU memory usage per node - used/allocated
      r816u29n04: 19.9GB/256.0GB (5.0GB/64.0GB per core of 4)

```
