### Announcements

#### McCleary Now Available

The [new McCleary HPC cluster](/clusters/mccleary) is now available for active Farnam and Ruddle usersâ€“all other researchers who conduct life sciences research can request an account using our [Account Request form](https://research.computing.yale.edu/support/hpc/account-request). Farnam and Ruddle will be retired in mid-2023 so we encourage all users on those clusters to transition their work to McCleary at your earliest convenience. If you see any issues on the new cluster or have any questions, please let us know at [hpc@yale.edu](mailto:hpc@yale.edu).

#### Open OnDemand VSCode Available Everywhere

A new OOD app code-server is now available on all YCRC clusters, including Milgram and McCleary. The new code-server allows you to run VSCode in a browser on a compute node. All users who have been running VSCode on a login node via the ssh extension should switch to code-server at their earliest convenience. Unlike VSCode on the login node, the new app also enables you to use GPUs, to allocate large memory nodes, and to specify a private partition (if applicable) The app is still in beta version and your feedback is much appreciated.

### Software Highlights

* GPU-enabled LAMMPS (**LAMMPS/23Jun2022-foss-2020b-kokkos-CUDA-11.3.1**) is now available on Grace.
* **AlphaFold/2.3.1-fosscuda-2020b** is now available on Farnam and McCleary.
