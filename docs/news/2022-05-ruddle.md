## Ruddle Maintenance
_May 2, 2022_

### Software Updates

- Security updates
- Slurm updated to 21.08.7
- Singularity replaced by Apptainer version 1.0.1 (note: the "singularity" command will still work as expected)
- Lmod updated to 8.7

### Changes to non-interactive sessions

Non-interactive sessions (e.g. file transfers, commands sent over ssh) no longer load the standard cluster environment to alleviate performance issues due to unnecessary module loads.
Please contact us if this change affects your workflow so we can resolve the issue or provide a workaround.
