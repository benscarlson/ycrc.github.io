The Bouchet HPC cluster is now available for all Yale researchers. Bouchet contains approximately 10,000 direct-liquid-cooled cores as well as 48 NVIDIA A5000Ada GPUs. 80 NVIDIA H200 GPUs will be added to Bouchet in early July. Accounts on Bouchet can be requested now via the [YCRC Account Request Form](https://research.computing.yale.edu/account-request).

Dates will be announced soon! 

#### New YCGA Sequence Data Archive - Enhanced Access to Your Files

Weâ€™ve launched the new YCGA sequence data archive with a user-friendly web interface to enable simplified retrieval of the archived sequence files. This is a replacement for the existing methods using the ycgaFastq and URLFetch scripts. The new system offers improved performance, reliability, and security, including required CAS login and research group access restrictions.  All of the data in the previous sequence archive has been migrated to the new archive.
For more information and instructions on how to retrieve your files,visit [https://archive.ycga.yale.edu/](https://archive.ycga.yale.edu/) (You must be on Yale network and log in via CAS to access) and [https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/data/ycga-data/](/data/ycga-data/) If you need assistance, please [contact us](/#get-help) for assistance. 

#### Troubleshooting Open OnDemand Issues

If you are experiencing problems with Open OnDemand, such as inability to access the portal or  failures when launching apps, we suggest trying the following solutions to improve performance.

- **Check your storage space.** Open OnDemand won't launch if your home directory is full. Verify you haven't exceeded your user quota.
- **Clear your browser cache completely.** Use a private browsing window or clear your entire browser cache (not just the last 24 hours). This resolves most session-related issues.
- **For unresponsive RStudio sessions:** If RStudio becomes slow or stops responding, terminate the session and run this command at the shell prompt:

```
ycrc_clean_rstudio.sh
```

This removes temporary RStudio files and allows a fresh start.

Need more help? Additional troubleshooting steps are available in [our R documentation](/access/ood/).
