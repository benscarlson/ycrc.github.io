## Milgram Maintenance
_August_ 22, 2023_

### Software Updates

- Slurm updated to 22.05.9
- NVIDIA drivers updated to 535.86.10
- Apptainer updated to 1.2.42
- Open OnDemand updated to 2.0.32

### Multi-Factor Authentication

[Multi-factor authentication](https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/access/mfa/) is now required for ssh for all users on Milgram.  For most usage, this additional step is minimally invasive and makes our clusters much more secure.  However, for users who use graphical transfer tools such as Cyberduck, please see our [MFA transfer documentation](https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/data/transfer/#cyberduck-on-mccleary-and-ruddle).
