## Milgram Maintenance
_August 20-22, 2024_

### Software Updates

- Slurm updated to 23.11.9
- NVIDIA drivers updated to 555.42.06
- Apptainer updated to 1.3.3

### Hardware Updates

- We proactively replaced two core file servers, as part of our best practices for GPFS (our high-performance parallel filesystem).  This does not change our storage capacity, but allows us to maintain existing services and access future upgrades.
