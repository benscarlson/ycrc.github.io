### Announcements

#### McCleary in Production Status

During March, we have been adding nodes to McCleary, including large memory nodes (4 TiB), GPU nodes and migrating most of the commons nodes from Farnam to McCleary (that are not being retired). Moreover, we have finalized the setup of McCleary and the system is now production stable. Please feel comfortable to migrate your data and workloads from Farnam and Ruddle to McCleary at your earliest convenience.

#### New YCGA Nodes Online on McCleary

McCleary now has over 3000 new cores dedicated to YCGA work!
