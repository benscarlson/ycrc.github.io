#### Upcoming Milgram RHEL8 Upgrade

As Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 approaches its end of life, we will be upgrading the Milgram cluster from RHEL7 to RHEL8 during the February maintenance window.  This will bring Milgram in line with our other clusters and provide a number of key benefits:
continued security patches and support beyond 2024,
updated system libraries to better support modern software,
improved node management system

We have set aside rhel8_devel and rhel8_day partitions for use in debugging and testing of workflows before the February maintenance. For more information on testing your workflows [see our explainer](https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters/milgram_rhel8/).
