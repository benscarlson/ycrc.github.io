### Announcements

#### Ruddle Maintenance
The biannual scheduled maintenance for the Ruddle cluster will be occurring May 3-5. During this time, the cluster will be unavailable. See the Ruddle maintenance email announcements for more details.

#### Remote Visualization with Hardware Acceleration
VirtualGL is installed on all GPU nodes on Grace, Farnam, and Milgram to provide hardware accelerated 3D rendering. Instructions on how to use VirtualGL to accelerate your 3D applications can be found at [https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/guides/virtualgl/](https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/guides/virtualgl/). 

### Software Highlights

- **Singularity is now called "Apptainer".** Singularity is officially named “Apptainer” as part of its move to the Linux Foundation. The new command `apptainer` works as drop-in replacement for `singularity`. However, the previous `singularity` command will also continue to work for the foreseeable future so no change is needed. The upgrade to Apptainer is on Grace, Farnam and Ruddle (as of the maintenance completion). Milgram will be upgraded to Apptainer during the June maintenance.
- **Slurm** has been upgraded to version 21.08.6 on Grace
- **MATLAB/2022a** is available on all clusters
