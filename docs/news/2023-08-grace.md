## Grace Maintenance
_August 15-17, 2023_

### Software Updates

- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) updated to 8.8
- Slurm updated to 22.05.9
- NVIDIA drivers updated to 535.86.10
- Apptainer updated to 1.2.2
- Open OnDemand updated to 2.0.32

### Upgrade to Red Hat 8

As part of this maintenance, the operating system on Grace has been upgraded to Red Hat 8.  A new unified software tree that is shared with the McCleary cluster has been created.
 
The ssh host keys for Grace's login nodes were changed during the maintenance, which will result in a "WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!" error when you attempt to login. To access the cluster again, first remove the old host keys with the following command (if accessing the cluster via command line):

```
ssh-keygen -R grace.hpc.yale.edu
```

If you are using a GUI, such as MobaXterm, you will need to manually edit your known host file and remove the list related to Grace.
For MobaXterm, this file is located (by default) in `Documents\MobaXterm\home\.ssh`.

Then attempt a new login and accept the new host key.

### New Open OnDemand (Web Portal) URL
 
The new URL for the Grace Open OnDemand web portal is [https://ood-grace.ycrc.yale.edu](https://ood-grace.ycrc.yale.edu).
