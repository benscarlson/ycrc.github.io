### Announcements

#### Announcing Hopper, the new YCRC Secure HPC Cluster

We are thrilled to announce the availability of the Hopper HPC cluster. Hopper is a NIST 800-171/HIPAA compliant secure computing environment for all researchers at Yale University for high performance computation of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI), NIH Controlled-Access Data, Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and other types of sensitive data. 

More information about Hopper can be found at [https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters/hopper/](https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters/hopper/).

Email us at [research.computing@yale.edu](mailto:research.computing@yale.edu) to inquire about using Hopper.


#### Beta Testing Complete for H200 GPUs on Bouchet

The beta testing of the H200 GPUs on the Bouchet cluster is now complete and the cluster is available to all Yale researchers for projects with low-risk data. Similar to Grace and McCleary, compute resources are available to all researchers at no cost. If you have used Grace or McCleary since July 1, 2024, we have automatically created an account for you on Bouchet. If you have uploaded ssh keys to Grace or McCleary, your key will already be installed on Bouchet. If you are unsure if you have an account, please try logging into [Bouchetâ€™s Open OnDemand web portal](https://ood-bouchet.ycrc.yale.edu) (Yale VPN required) before submitting an account request.
If an account was not automatically created for you on Bouchet, please [submit an account request](https://research.computing.yale.edu/account-request).

Bouchet follows most of the same paradigms as Grace and McCleary, but there are a [small number of key differences](/clusters/bouchet_getting_started/). We encourage you to review those differences before starting work on Bouchet. If you are new to the YCRC clusters, we recommend getting started with [our Intro to HPC training video](https://research.computing.yale.edu/intro-to-hpc).

#### Expanded Office Hours Now Available

We're excited to announce that we've expanded our Office Hours to make it even easier for you to get the research computing support you need! Join us for drop-in consultations on Wednesdays 11am-12pm and our **new** Thursday 2-3pm slot [via Zoom](https://yale.zoom.us/my/ycrcsupport) - no appointment needed. 

Please check the OHs schedule at [https://research.computing.yale.edu/training-events](https://research.computing.yale.edu/training-events) for any changes.

Our Research Support team is here to help you navigate YCRC computing resources, evaluate your project's computational needs, and optimize your workflows from basic setup to advanced applications. Office Hours are perfect for quick consultations (approximately 15 minutes) on general YCRC questions, novice user support, resource monitoring, and troubleshooting common issues like missing libraries. For more complex needs such as custom software installations, detailed code troubleshooting, or miniconda environment setup, we encourage you to contact us at research.computing@yale.edu to schedule a dedicated 1-on-1 consultation where we can provide the focused attention your project deserves. 

Whether you're just getting started or working with exceptional computational requirements, we're here to collaborate with you and ensure you're making the most of Yale's research computing resources.

Learn more about the computational research support services our team provides at https://research.computing.yale.edu/research-support/services and [contact us](/#get-help) with any questions. 


#### New YCRC Website

In early August, we launched our new website--[research.computing.yale.edu](https://research.computing.yale.edu), which was built on the new Yale Sites platform. We hope the new site will prove to be user friendly and informative. Please share any feedback and suggestions for improvement by [contacting the web editor](https://research.computing.yale.edu/contact-web-editor).
