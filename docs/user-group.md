# YCRC User Group

The YCRC User Group is a community of researchers at Yale who utilize computing resources and technology to enable their research. The User Group holds monthly meetings, each on a distinct topic of interest to the community. During meeting there are opportunities for members of the research community to teach and learn from their peers in a mix of panel discussions, presentations, lightning talks, working groups and informal discussions.
