# Guides to Software & Tools

The YCRC installs and manage commonly used software. These software are available as modules, which allow you to add or remove different combinations and versions of software to your environment as needed. See our [software module guide](/applications/modules) for more information. To see all pre-installed software, you can run `module avail` on a cluster to page through all available software.

For certain software packages, we provide guides for running on our clusters. If you have tips for running a commonly used software and would like to contribute them to our Software Guides, [contact us](/#get-help) or submit a pull request on the [docs repo](https://github.com/ycrc/ycrc.github.io/tree/src/).
