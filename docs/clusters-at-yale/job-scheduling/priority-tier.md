# Priority Tier

## Overview

Effective December 1st 2024, the current YCRC CPU-Hour based service charges will be replaced with new Priority Tier service charges.
The YCRC is adding a new Priority Tier of partitions that will be an opt-in, fast lane for computational jobs. 
All computation on the “standard” tier of partitions (e.g. day, week, mpi, gpu, scavenge) will no longer incur charges.
Private nodes and partitions will continue to not incur charges.


## Access

Access to Priority Tier partitions is granted upon request through the [Priority Tier Access Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gXaOiOwmU-YY1Q5k2mJJRmEHTeJcBs9BlkJ7n1akF1Q).
This form must be submitted by the group’s PI (or delegate).

During the Priority Tier onboarding process, the YCRC will require charging instructions and a list of members in your group who should have access (and therefore the privileges to incur charges) before access can be granted.
Additional group members can be added to Priority Tier at any time by submitted a request to [hpc@yale.edu](mailto:hpc@yale.edu).

We also strongly recommend providing an annual budget, beyond which no additional computation will occur. Note this limit can be changed at any time upon request.
