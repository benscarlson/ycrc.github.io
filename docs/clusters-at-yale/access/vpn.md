# Access from Off Campus (VPN)

Yale's clusters can only be accessed on the Yale network. Therefore, in order to access a cluster from off campus, you will need to first connect to Yale's VPN. More information about Yale's VPN can be found on the [ITS website](https://yale.service-now.com/it?id=service_offering&sys_id=c4684dcd6fbb31007ee2abcf9f3ee4f2).

## VPN Software
### Windows and macOS

We recommend the Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client, which can be downloaded from the [ITS Software Library](http://software.yale.edu/software/cisco-vpn-anyconnect).

### Linux

On Linux, you can use [openconnect](http://www.infradead.org/openconnect) to connect to one of Yale's VPNs. If you are using the standard Gnome-based distros, use the commands below to install.

Ubuntu/Debian

``` bash
sudo apt install network-manager-openconnect-gnome
```

Fedora/CentOS

``` bash
sudo yum install NetworkManager-openconnect
```

## Connect via VPN

You will need to connect via the VPN client using the profile "access.yale.edu".

### Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

Authentication for the VPN requires multi-factor authentication via Duo in addition to your normal Yale credentials (netid and password). After you select "Connect" in the above dialog box, you will be presented with a new prompt to enter your netid, password and an MFA method.

Depending on what you choose you will be prompted to authenticate via a second authentication method.

* If you type "push", simply tap "Approve" on your mobile device.
* If you type "sms" you will receive a text message with your passcode. Enter the passcode you received to authenticate.
* If you type "phone", follow the prompts when you are called.

Once you successfully authenticate with MFA, you will be connected to the VPN and should be able to log in the clusters via SSH as usual.

More information about MFA at Yale can be found on the [ITS website](https://cybersecurity.yale.edu/mfa).
