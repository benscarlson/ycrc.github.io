# Log on to the Clusters

To log on the cluster, you must first [request an account](https://research.computing.yale.edu/support/hpc/account-request) (if you do not already have one). When using the clusters, please review and abide by our [HPC usage policies and best practices](/clusters-at-yale/access/accounts).

!!! info "Off Campus Access"

    You must be on the campus network to access the clusters. For off-campus access you need to use the [Yale VPN](vpn).


## Web Portal - Open OnDemand

For most users, we recommend using the web portal, Open OnDemand, to access the clusters. For hostnames and more instructions see our [Open OnDemand](/clusters-at-yale/access/ood) documentation.

## SSH Connection

For more advanced use cases that are not well supported by the Web Portal (Open OnDemand), you can connect to the clusters over the more traditional [SSH connection](/clusters-at-yale/access/ssh).
