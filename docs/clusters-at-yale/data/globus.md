# Large Transfers with Globus

For large data transfers both within Yale and to external collaborators, we recommend using Globus. Globus is a file transfer service that is efficient and easy to use. It has several advantages:

* Robust and fast transfers of large files and/or large collections of files.
* Files can be transferred between your computer and the clusters.
* Files can be transferred between Yale and other sites.
* A web and command-line interface for starting and monitoring transfers.
* Access to specific files or directories granted to external collaborators in a secure way.

Globus transfers data between computers set up as "endpoints". The official YCRC endpoints are listed below. Transfers can be to and from these endpoints or those you have defined for yourself with [Globus Connect](#setup-an-endpoint-on-your-computer).

## Cluster Endpoints

We currently support endpoints for the following clusters.

| Cluster                                     | Globus Endpoint |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| [Farnam](/clusters-at-yale/clusters/farnam) | `yale#farnam`   |
| [Grace](/clusters-at-yale/clusters/grace)   | `yale#grace`    |
| [Ruddle](/clusters-at-yale/clusters/ruddle) | `yale#ruddle`   |

These endpoints provide access to all files you normally have access to, except sequencing data on Ruddle.

For more information, please see the [official Globus Documentation](https://docs.globus.org/how-to).

## Setup an Endpoint on Your Computer

You can set up your own endpoint for transferring data to and from your own computer with [Globus Connect Personal](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect). 

To transfer or share data between two personal endpoints, you will need to request access to the YCRC's Globus Plus subscription on [this page](https://app.globus.org/groups/8f3fced6-4318-11e3-9f63-12313809f035/about).


## Setup a Google Drive Endpoint
