# Overview

## Software Modules

The YCRC will install and manage commonly used software. These software are available as modules, which allow you to add or remove different combinations and versions of software to your environment as needed. See [our module guide](/clusters-at-yale/applications/modules) for more info. You can run `module avail` to page through all available software once you log in.

## Conda, Python & R

You should also feel free to install things for yourself. See our [Conda](/clusters-at-yale/guides/conda), [Python](/clusters-at-yale/guides/python/), [R](/clusters-at-yale/guides/python) guides for guidance on running these on the clusters.

## Compile Your Own Software

For all other software, we encourage users to attempt to install their own software into their directories. Here are instructions for common software procedures.

- [Make](/clusters-at-yale/applications/compile/#autotools-configuremake)
- [Cmake](/clusters-at-yale/applications/compile/#cmake)
- [Apptainer](/clusters-at-yale/guides/containers): create containers and port Docker containers to the clusters (formerly know as "Singularity")

If you run into issues with your software installations, [contact us](/#get-help).

## Software Guides

We provide [additional guides for running specific software on the clusters](/clusters-at-yale/guides/) as well.
