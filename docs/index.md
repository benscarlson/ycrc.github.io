    If you're doing computational research related to COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 on an HPC cluster and experience any long wait times for jobs to run, [please let us know](mailto:hpc@yale.edu).

# Introduction

The Yale Center for Research Computing provides support for research computing at Yale University. Our most active area for support is High Performance Computing, however we also support other computationally intensive research.  In addition, we work with faculty and research groups across disciplines to design and maintain cost-effective computing capabilities.

## Get Help

To best serve the research community, we provide one-on-one consulting and use a support tracking system.

!!! info "Troubleshooting Login Issues"
    If you are experiencing issues logging into one of the clusters, please first check the current [System Status](http://research.computing.yale.edu/system-status) for known issues and check the [Troubleshoot Login guide](/clusters-at-yale/troubleshoot) first before seeking additional assistance.

### Web and Email Support

To submit requests, issues, or questions please send us an email at [hpc@yale.edu](mailto:hpc@yale.edu) or sign on to our online support system at [help.ycrc.yale.edu](https://help.ycrc.yale.edu). Your login credentials there are your email and a password of your choosing, not your CAS password.

Once received, our system will send an automated response with a link to a ticket. From there we'll track your ticket and make sure it's handled properly by the right person. Replies via email or the online support system go to the same place and are interchangeable. Constructive feedback is much appreciated.

### YouTube Channel

The [YCRC YouTube channel](https://ycrc.yale.edu/youtube) features recorded tutorials and workshops that cover a wide range of computing topics.
New videos are added regularly and suggestions for topics can be submitted by emailing [research.computing@yale.edu](mailto:research.computing@yale.edu).

### One-on-One Support

!!! question "Office Hours"
    Consistent with University guidance in response to COVID-19, <strong>one-on-one consulting and office hours are held remotely</strong>.

Many of the research support team members hold regular office hours you can self-schedule via Google Calendar (Google/EliApps account required). When you book an appointment this way, add the topics you want to discuss in the description field. By default, Google Meet links are generated for appointments made this way. If you strongly prefer Zoom, please let us know in the description field. 

If you are unsure about who can best help, email us at [hpc@yale.edu](mailto:hpcg@yale.edu) with as much detail as possible about your request and we'll find the right person for you.
